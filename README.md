### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
1. Previous coding experience
- A few survey courses. Nothing all too-in-depth
2. Reasons for taking this class
- To become more familiar with the realm of coding
3. Other interests (academic or otherwise)
- Finance: evaluation of the stock market
4. Goals you have for this class and/or projects you'd like to complete
- Programming a video game 

Recursive Art (10/1)
My recursive art project is based on the idea of SierpiÅ„ski's triangles
 The project details a filled-in black triangle that, from its initial level change from 0 to 1, adds a white triangle (inscribed and connected by the larger triangle's
 midpoints). Each white triangle from that point forward is drawn outside the interior white triangle's boundaries to each specific midpoint.
1. Reflection on learning (things I'm proud of /takeaways)
  - Realized the importance of modular coding; it not only makes code readable but more manageable
  - Grasped the essence of recursion; it's like solving a puzzle, breaking it into smaller pieces to see the whole picture more clearly
2. Potential for enhancement (things I would incorporate/refine)
  - Implement full user interaction: the code could prompt the user more interactively, possibly asking for different sizes or points to draw the triangle. It will allow users to create more customized shapes.
  - Enhance error handling: The code can be made more robust by adding more appropriate error-handling mechanisms, for instance, checking if the user input is a valid integer
